# TODO
- como funciona recalcular com atraso
- minimizar variacoes no atraso replanejamento (funcao minimizar recebe dois parametros)
- use standa 13 o maximo possivel

**Optimization criteria:** 
- Robustness
- Minimal number of bus transportations

**Preferences:**
1. Stands 11 and 12 for non-Schengen flights <<<<OK>>>>
2. Use stand 13 as much as possible <<mesmo>>
3. Use stands near borders for day trip turns <<<mesmo>>>

**Restrictions:**
1. Two departing flights cannot be on adjacent stands at the same time
2. Prefer gate stands for flights with many passengers
3. Aircrafts with large wingspans cannot be on adjacent stands at the same time <<<<OK>>>>
