# Suppose:
# 010
# 001
# 100
# 000

# I know the number of passengers for each plane
# I know the distance from each gate to the delivery point for each plane
# I know which gates require buses
# So I know the cost:
# cost = 500 * passengers * distance if bus_required
# cost = 100 * passengers * distance otherwise
# I want to minimize the total cost


# FOR THIS EXAMPLE THE SOLUTION MUST BE
# Airplane 0 assignment:
# Gate 1
# Airplane 1 assignment:
# Gate 2
# Airplane 2 assignment:
# Gate 0
# Because gate 3 is a complete disaster, so no planes go there
# Because gate 1 is a semi-disaster, so the plane with least passengers goes there
# Because gate 2 is the cheapest, the plane with most passengers goes there
# FOR THIS SCENARIO, the heuristics works, but it is not guaranteed to work for all scenarios

# TODO all combinations in a spresheet
# 4! = 24 combinations

# but if it is a large number and other constraints becomes really hard!
